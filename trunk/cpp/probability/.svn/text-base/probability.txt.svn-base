Expected Value: weighted average of all possible outcomes of a
variable X
ex: in case of dice, Expected value of outcome is
1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1/6 + ...+ 6 * 1/6

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

Conditional probability:
for two non-independent events A and B,
P(B | A) = P(A and B)/P(A)
